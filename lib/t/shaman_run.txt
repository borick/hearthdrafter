Spectral Knight
73.34
1 Normally this would be a toss-up between Flametongue Totem and Spectral Knight. So, Flametongue Totem might not fit in our slower Mid-Range deck and we don't really want to end up with too many Flametongue Totems. All in all, I suggest you pick Spectral Knight in this situation.
Lightning Bolt

Stormforged Axe
81.36
7 Although we don't really want to end up with too many cards with overload, I still suggest you pick Stormforged Axe as it has the most value out of these options, we could use a card to play early game and we could use a ping.

Bloodsail Raider
55.28
1 Normally I would pick Earth Shock. However, we really don't want to end up with too many Earth Shocks. On top of that, Bloodsail Raider has some synergy with the deck. All in all, I suggest you pick Bloodsail Raider in this situation.
